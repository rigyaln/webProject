            5G stands for 
            “fifth generation” as in <br>the 
            fifth generation of Wireless Cellular Technology. 
            5G is currently the latest generation of wireless 
            cellular technology being currently used by the 
            public and is very different from a technical 
            standpoint to its previous generations. 
            5G’s speed is “designed to deliver peak data rates 
            up to 20 Gbps based on IMT-2020 requirements.”
